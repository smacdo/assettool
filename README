Assettool is a ruby script that helps manage and automate a game's asset
pipeline process. This tool was created to help my personal OpenGL projects
along, but my hope is other people will take it for a spin and send in
feature requests that make it useful to others.

Currently, the tool's main focus is on managing a repository of raw
assets and converting them into a optimized binary format or a simple xml
data file. Eventually I would like to decouple the export and import
process (its already somewhat decoupled) to allow for arbitrary formats.

The binary format will be documented in FORMAT. It is straight forward and
simple to use. The xml format is not documented at the moment, but
it follows the binary format and should be immediately obvious by looking
at an ouputted file.
